# promise-from-scratch
A TypeScript and Node.js implementation of a custom promise, built from the ground up to understand the inner workings of asynchronous programming in JavaScript. This project replicates core features of native JavaScript promises, including *then*, *catch*, and *finally*, while exploring how promises handle chaining, error propagation, and asynchronous resolution.

## Features

* Full custom implementation of a promise.
* Support for chaining with then.
* Error handling using catch.
* Finalization support via finally.
* Detailed comments and documentation for learning purposes.
